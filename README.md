# Food Delivery

## About
Initially, this project served as an ASP.Net tutorial for CS4790 at Weber State University. For an undergraduate-graduate level course, CS5450 Software Evolution and Maintenance, I rearchitected and refactored the application. I used various tools to increase maintainability, and the following link contains an overview.
